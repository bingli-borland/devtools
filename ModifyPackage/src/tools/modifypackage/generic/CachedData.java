/** This is a thread safe wrapper for data that allows many threads
 * to read the data, but only a single thread to write it.
 * The idea is that the first access to the data causes it to
 * be initialized by the compute() method.  This requires a
 * writeLock.  Normal access to the data only requires a
 * read lock, so normally any number of threads can access
 * the data without contention.  It is also possible to
 * flush that cached data.
 * <p>
 * Typical use of this class looks something like:
 * <pre>
 * private CachedData<Foo> myfoo = new CachedData() {
 *     protected Foo compute() {
 *         ...
 *         return new Foo( ... ) ;
 *     }
 * } ;
 * ...
 * Foo foo = myfoo.get() ;
 * try {
 *     .... // do something with foo
 * } finally {
 *     myfoo.release() ;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note in particular that every get call must be paired
 * with a release call, otherwise any attempt to call
 * flush() will block indefinitely.
